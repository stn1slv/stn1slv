🔍 [10 API Linters and Description Validators](https://nordicapis.com/10-api-linters-and-description-validators/)

_API linting and validation tools are essential for ensuring code consistency and functionality in 2025, with options ranging from AI-enriched solutions like LintGPT to specialized tools for different languages such as Spectral for JSON/YAML, Redocly CLI for OpenAPI, and language-specific options like ESLint for JavaScript, Pylint for Python, and GolangCI-Lint for Go. These tools help enforce coding standards, catch issues before deployment, and ensure APIs function as intended by checking against specifications._

🔍 [6 Ways to Absolutely Fail at API Governance](https://nordicapis.com/6-ways-to-absolutely-fail-at-api-governance/)

_API governance requires a balanced approach that avoids being too rigid or too lax, adapts to different API contexts, and promotes standardization without stifling innovation. Effective governance strategies include consistent implementation across teams, proper lifecycle management, robust monitoring, automation of standards enforcement, and mechanisms for developer feedback—all working together to create a flexible framework that evolves with organizational needs._

🔍 [9 Signs You're Doing API Security Wrong](https://nordicapis.com/9-signs-youre-doing-api-security-wrong/)

_The article outlines nine common API security anti-patterns, including overreliance on API keys, lack of smart authorization flows, improper encryption, outdated dependencies, inconsistent authentication standards, absence of rate limiting, insufficient data filtering, poor logging, and improper CORS configuration. For each issue, the author provides best practices to mitigate risks, emphasizing that security requires constant vigilance and a holistic approach rather than treating it as a one-time process._

🔍 [API Design Basics: Cacheability](https://apisyouwonthate.com/blog/api-design-basics-cacheability/)

_HTTP caching is an integral part of API design that allows clients to reuse data they already have, reducing server load and costs. By using headers like Cache-Control and ETag, APIs can specify how long responses can be cached and provide mechanisms to check if data has changed, which not only improves performance but also reduces carbon emissions by minimizing unnecessary requests and server processing._

🔍 [API Design Basics: File Uploads](https://apisyouwonthate.com/blog/api-design-basics-file-uploads/)

_The article explains different approaches to handling file uploads in APIs, including direct file uploads, uploading from URLs, and separating metadata from file content. It emphasizes the importance of proper URL design, choosing appropriate HTTP methods (PUT or POST), and implementing security measures like content type validation, file size limits, and protection against attacks such as directory traversal and SSRF._

🔍 [API Governance Maturity Model](https://platformable.com/blog/api-governance-maturity-model)

_The API governance maturity model outlines four progressive levels to help organizations maximize API value, from fragmented processes to fully automated governance. Starting with identifying existing practices and commonalities, organizations can move toward standardization based on their context (centralized, federated, or platform-based) and gradually implement consistent design patterns, style guides, and automation tools that align with business strategy and support both internal and external API consumers._

🔍 [Avoiding Breaking Changes in APIs: Lessons from the Field](https://medium.com/@breako/avoiding-breaking-changes-in-apis-lessons-from-the-field-ffe43d451cf3)

_RESTful APIs have gained popularity over RPC approaches like SOAP and RMI because they allow for easier software evolution without requiring client code updates with each interface change. Unlike RPC approaches where client stubs need regeneration when interfaces change, RESTful APIs minimize breaking changes by following principles like Postel's Law and uniform interface principles, allowing clients to ignore new resources they don't need while making additive changes non-breaking._

🔍 [Designing a Retry Strategy for Transient Errors](https://medium.com/@bogomolalexander/designing-a-retry-strategy-for-transient-errors-a5cd8b4d0602)

_The article discusses the optimal placement of retry strategies in Mulesoft's API-led connectivity architecture, demonstrating how implementing retry logic at multiple layers can lead to redundant retries when errors occur at the backend. It recommends implementing retry logic closest to the system that triggered the connectivity issue and avoiding error propagation by replacing transient error codes (like 504) with standard ones (like 500) when passing errors to upper layers, aligning with best practices from major cloud providers to prevent cascading retry attempts._
