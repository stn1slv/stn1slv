üîç [3 Ways to String Multiple APIs Together](https://nordicapis.com/3-ways-to-string-multiple-apis-together/)

*Explores three approaches for connecting multiple APIs: serialized flows (piping output from one API to another), specification-driven sequences using Arazzo Specification for formal workflow definition, and AI-orchestrated connections using LLMs to determine next API calls. The article emphasizes that the choice depends on your system architecture and notes that API connectivity is rapidly evolving with new solutions like Model Context Protocol.*

üîç [API Governance Made Simple: 8 Rules to Avoid API Chaos in Your System](https://medium.com/@neliia/api-governance-made-simple-8-rules-to-avoid-api-chaos-in-your-system-3bf45c24dc06)

*Presents eight key rules for effective API governance: centralization of standards, API contracts using specifications like OpenAPI, implementation guidelines for consistency, security policies, automation for compliance verification, versioning strategies, deprecation policies, and API discovery through centralized catalogs. The article emphasizes that proper governance keeps APIs consistent, secure, and reduces development costs while avoiding chaos in distributed systems.*

üîç [API Specificity with Overlays and Enums](https://lornajane.net/posts/2025/api-specificity-with-overlays-and-enums)

üîç [On the Behavior of OpenAPI's oneOf](https://apichangelog.substack.com/p/on-the-behavior-of-openapi-oneof)

*Explains how OpenAPI's oneOf keyword works for defining polymorphism, requiring data to validate against exactly one schema from a list. The article covers common challenges like avoiding multiple schema matches and recommends using discriminator properties and additionalProperties controls for better validation.*

üîç [OpenAPI 3.0 vs. OpenAPI 3.1: What's Changed and Why It's Important](https://document360.com/blog/openapi-3-0-vs-openapi-3-1/)

üîç [OpenAPI 3.2 - What to expect?](https://bump.sh/blog/openapi-3-2-what-to-expect/)

*Previews upcoming features in OpenAPI 3.2, which will be fully backwards compatible with 3.1 while adding new OAuth flow support, display name extensions, and additional HTTP methods. The release is expected in August 2025 and focuses on community-requested improvements.*

üîç [The 5 Best API Docs Tools in 2025](https://apisyouwonthate.com/blog/top-5-best-api-docs-tools/)

*Reviews five leading API documentation tools including Redoc, Scalar, Stoplight Elements, Bump.sh, and ReadMe, comparing their features, pricing, and ideal use cases. The article emphasizes that the best choice depends on factors like team size, budget, and whether you need single or multiple API support.*

üîç [The company that created Kafka is replacing it with a new solution](https://vutr.substack.com/p/the-company-that-created-kafka-is)

*Details how LinkedIn built Northguard as a replacement for Kafka to address scalability challenges at their massive scale of 150 clusters and 17PB of daily data. The new system uses segment-based replication instead of partition-based replication and includes Xinfra as a virtualization layer to enable gradual migration from Kafka.*

üîç [The Role of AI Gateways and How They Work With APIs](https://nordicapis.com/the-role-of-ai-gateways-and-how-they-work-with-apis/)

*Explains how AI gateways act as middleware layers between applications and AI services, providing centralized access management, enhanced security, intelligent traffic routing, and cost control. The article covers practical use cases including enterprise AI platforms, multi-provider orchestration for SaaS products, mobile app content moderation, and government compliance scenarios, emphasizing their crucial role in production-scale AI deployments.*

üîç [Why API Gateways Shouldn't Handle Identity Alone](https://nordicapis.com/why-api-gateways-shouldnt-handle-identity-alone/)

*Argues that API gateways should focus on traffic management rather than complex identity operations, which should be delegated to specialized identity providers. The article discusses patterns like token introspection, phantom tokens, and Backend-for-Frontend to maintain clean separation between transport and security concerns.*
