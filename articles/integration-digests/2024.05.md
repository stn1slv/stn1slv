üîç [5 Improvements to OpenAPI Operation Documentation](https://bump.sh/blog/5-improvements-to-openapi-operation-documentation)

_The article suggests five ways to improve OpenAPI operation documentation: expanding operation descriptions to provide more details; adding examples to API operations and schema for better understanding; documenting common response codes to guide users on error formats; organizing and tagging API operations for easier navigation; and improving consistency in operation naming conventions to reduce confusion. The author also recommends involving technical writers early in the API design process to enhance the developer experience._

üîç [API Documentation Checklist](https://bump.sh/blog/api-documentation-checklist)

_The article provides a comprehensive checklist for creating effective API documentation, which includes an overview and introduction, authentication and authorization guide, getting started guide, reference documentation, error handling, rate limiting and quotas, versioning and deprecation policy, support and community, feedback and contribution, and legal and compliance. It also suggests post-launch improvements such as updating community events, SDKs and libraries, examples and tutorials, reference applications, and industry use cases. The author emphasizes the importance of regular updates and improvements to keep the documentation relevant and user-friendly._

üîç [API catalog vs. API developer portal: main differences](https://www.getport.io/blog/api-catalog-vs-api-developer)

_The article differentiates between API catalogs and API developer portals. API catalogs serve as a central repository for all APIs, aiding developers in discovering and understanding APIs. API developer portals, however, offer a platform for managing the entire API lifecycle and integrate with API management tools for added functionalities._

üîç [AsyncAPI gets a new version 3.0 and new operations](https://medium.com/google-cloud/asyncapi-gets-a-new-version-3-0-and-new-operations-013dd1d6265b)

_The article announces the release of AsyncAPI 3.0, a new version of the open-source specification that standardizes asynchronous API documentation. The update introduces new operations, including 'connect', 'disconnect', 'bind', and 'unbind', expanding its use beyond just messaging APIs to cover other asynchronous interactions._

üîç [Improving Schema Component Documentation in OpenAPI Documents](https://bump.sh/blog/improving-schema-component-documentation-in-openapi-documents)

_The article provides tips for improving schema component documentation in OpenAPI documents, which can enhance usability and reduce integration times. Suggestions include including examples in schema components, documenting formats not covered by OpenAPI specification, clarifying required and optional fields, documenting mutually exclusive fields and discriminator fields, using the 'oneOf' schema descriptor for legacy APIs, leveraging the 'allOf' schema descriptor for mixed responses, and providing comprehensive details such as minimum and maximum values for numeric fields, length constraints for strings, and enumerations that list possible values for a field._

üîç [Introducing new Proxy features in Microcks 1.9.1](https://microcks.io/blog/new-proxy-features-1.9.1/)

_The article introduces new proxy features in Microcks 1.9.1, an open-source project for API mocking. The new features include two dispatchers, PROXY and PROXY_FALLBACK, which provide simple and advanced proxy logic for REST, SOAP, and GraphQL protocols. The PROXY dispatcher changes the base URL of Microcks and makes a call to the real backend service, while the PROXY_FALLBACK dispatcher changes the base URL of the request and makes a call to the real service when no matching response is found within Microcks' dataset. These features allow for a smooth transition from mocked operations to real implementations._

üîç [Gen AI, APIs, and the Future of Development](https://nordicapis.com/gen-ai-apis-and-the-future-of-development/)

_The article discusses the rise of AI-generated code and its implications for API development. It highlights that while AI can write code and often outperform humans, the quality and functionality of AI-generated code can be inconsistent. The author suggests that developers may become stewards of AI-generated content, assessing its quality and approving its use. The article also predicts that AI tools will become significant API consumers, necessitating consideration of AI as a user persona when building and documenting APIs._

üîç [Problem Details (RFC9457): Doing API Errors Well‚Äã](https://swagger.io/blog/problem-details-rfc9457-doing-api-errors-well/)

_The article discusses the importance of effective error communication in HTTP APIs and introduces the Internet Engineering Task Force's (IETF) RFC 9457, a standard for expressing errors in a structured and helpful way. The author highlights common API error handling anti-patterns and emphasizes that adopting standardized practices like RFC 9457 can lead to a more reliable, secure, and user-friendly API ecosystem._

üîç [Problem Details (RFC 9457): Getting Hands-On with API Error Handling](https://swagger.io/blog/problem-details-rfc9457-api-error-handling/)

_The article discusses the importance of effective error handling in HTTP APIs and provides practical guidance on implementing the Internet Engineering Task Force's (IETF) RFC 9457, a standard for expressing errors in a structured and helpful way. The author provides examples of how to use the standard in API development, and highlights resources and tools that can help developers implement the standard more effectively. The article emphasizes that adopting such standardized practices can lead to a more reliable, secure, and user-friendly API ecosystem._
