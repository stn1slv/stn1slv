## Articles

üîç [10+ Signs You Might Need API Governance](https://nordicapis.com/10-signs-you-might-need-api-governance/)

*Lists practical indicators‚Äîsuch as a rapidly growing API catalog, external partners depending on your interfaces, or obligations under sector-specific regulations‚Äîthat suggest a formal governance model will pay off. The piece explains how lightweight standards, design reviews, and tooling reduce specification drift, security gaps, and version-management headaches. It also cautions that governance should be proportionate, so small teams avoid excessive bureaucracy while still gaining consistency.*

üîç [API Design Reviews Don't Have to be Hard](https://apisyouwonthate.com/blog/api-design-reviews-dont-have-to-be-hard/)

*Breaks down a collaborative review workflow where architects, developers, and technical writers examine pull requests that contain OpenAPI changes. By using Bump.sh to highlight semantic diffs, flag breaking changes, and generate previews, participants can focus on business logic and usability rather than raw YAML. The article shares tips on establishing checklists and feedback etiquette so the process remains fast and constructive.*

üîç [Developing Spectral Rules for AWS API Gateway OpenAPI Extensions](http://apievangelist.com/2025/05/09/developing-spectral-rules-for-aws-api-gateway-openapi-extensions/)

*Shows how to extend the Spectral linter with custom rules that validate AWS-specific x-amazon-apigateway extensions for integrations, authentication, and CORS. By running these rules against the OpenAPI document exported from a live Gateway, teams can confirm that runtime settings match design-time intentions. Sample rule snippets illustrate checks for correct VPC links, authorization types, and timeout values.*

üîç [Exploring OpenAPI Overlay Through Open Banking](https://nordicapis.com/exploring-openapi-overlay-through-open-banking/)

*Uses the fictional ‚ÄúBank of M&D‚Äù to demonstrate how the Overlay Specification can layer institution-specific tweaks onto the UK Open Banking reference APIs. Examples include removing unsupported endpoints, constraining enum values to products actually offered, and appending internal metadata‚Äîall without forking the base definition. The approach keeps regulatory alignment while making generated docs clearer for developers.*

üîç [Guide to EDI in Healthcare](https://boomi.com/blog/guide-to-edi-for-healthcare/)

*Explains core EDI standards (X12, EDIFACT, HL7) and how they streamline claims, eligibility checks, and supply-chain transactions among providers, payers, and vendors. Implementation guidance covers mapping tools, VAN selection, and compliance with HIPAA. Reported benefits include lower administrative overhead, fewer errors, and faster revenue cycles.*

üîç [How to Automate API Documentation](https://apichangelog.substack.com/p/how-to-automate-api-documentation)

*Describes a markdown-templating technique that injects content from an OpenAPI source into guides such as ‚ÄúGetting Started‚Äù or authentication tutorials. By referencing fields like security scheme descriptions or operation summaries as variables, the docs rebuild automatically whenever the spec changes. A sample GitHub Action and Handlebars template illustrate the end-to-end workflow.*

üîç [The 6 ETL Best Practices You Need to Know](https://boomi.com/blog/6-etl-best-practices/)

*Recommends strategies such as centralized error logging, data-quality profiling, incremental loads, and cross-functional design reviews to keep pipelines reliable. The article quantifies business impacts of bad data and ties each practice to cost avoidance, governance, and regulatory compliance goals. Security recommendations include role-based access and encrypted staging areas.*

### Apache Kafka

üîç [Deep dive into the challenges of building Kafka on top of S3](https://vutr.substack.com/p/deep-dive-into-the-challenges-of)

*Analyzes how decoupling compute from storage via S3 slashes cluster costs but introduces higher latency, metadata fan-out issues, and per-request IOPS fees. It surveys vendor techniques‚Äîtiered caches, compaction optimizations, and index offloading‚Äîto preserve throughput and ordering guarantees. Trade-offs around multi-AZ replication and failover are also discussed.*

üîç [If you're learning Kafka, this article is for you](https://vutr.substack.com/p/if-youre-learning-kafka-this-article)

*Offers a beginner-friendly tour of Kafka concepts‚Äîtopics, partitions, leaders, producer acks, and consumer groups‚Äîbefore diving into log-structured storage and zero-copy I/O. It contrasts the classic on-prem architecture with emerging cloud patterns that stage historical data in object storage. Diagrams and CLI snippets make the material approachable.*

üîç [Kafka Tiered Storage in depth: How Reads and Deletes Flow (Prefetching, Caching)](https://aiven.io/blog/kafka-tiered-storage-in-depth-how-reads-and-deletes-flow)

*Explores Kafka‚Äôs remote-storage plugin, showing how fetch requests trigger prefetch and cache layers to deliver near-local performance. Sequence charts illustrate coordination between brokers, object storage, and local disks. The article also details garbage-collection of orphaned segments and enforcement of retention settings when data spans multiple tiers.*

### Azure Logic Apps

üîç [Announcing the General Availability of the Azure Logic Apps Rules Engine](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-integration-services-blog/announcing-the-general-availability-of-the-azure-logic-apps/ba-p/4416707)

*Confirms GA of a RETE-based engine that evaluates complex, in-memory rule sets within Logic Apps Standard and Consumption plans. Users can author rules against XML or .NET objects, version them, and call the engine from workflow steps without external services. Microsoft positions the feature as a guardrail layer for AI agent loops and other dynamic flows.*

### Kong

üîç [Kong Event Gateway: Unifying the API and Events in a Single API Platform](https://konghq.com/blog/product-releases/kong-event-gateway)

*Introduces a gateway that exposes Kafka topics alongside traditional REST or gRPC endpoints, letting teams apply uniform authentication, rate limiting, and cataloging. Virtual Clusters and Virtual Topics abstract underlying Kafka infrastructure, so developers can self-serve streams without managing brokers. Both HTTP mediation and native Kafka wire protocols are supported.*

### Mulesoft

üîç [Using MuleSoft Object Store for Caching: What Persistent Really Means](https://medium.com/another-integration-blog/using-mulesoft-object-store-for-caching-what-persistent-really-means-04b4cf64ae7b)

*Details how CloudHub‚Äôs Object Store v2 offers multi-instance durability, whereas Runtime Fabric needs a PostgreSQL-backed Persistence Gateway and on-prem deployments write to local disk only. The article walks through TTL settings, eviction policies, and failover behavior in each environment. Recommendations help architects choose the right caching strategy for reliability and cost.*

## Mergers & Acquisitions

ü§ù [Salesforce acquires Informatica](https://investor.salesforce.com/news/news-details/2025/Salesforce-Signs-Definitive-Agreement-to-Acquire-Informatica/default.aspx)
