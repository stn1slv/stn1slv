üîç [Organizing APIs in System, Business, and Experience Layers](https://apihandyman.io/organizing-apis-in-layers-system-business-and-experience-apis/)

*This article proposes organizing APIs into three distinct layers to manage complexity in large organizations. System APIs provide direct, low-level access to backend systems, Business APIs offer clean, reusable interfaces for core business functions, and Experience APIs are tailored for specific frontend applications or consumer needs.*

üîç [Underestimated and unexpected IT challenges of API initiatives](https://apihandyman.io/underestimated-and-unexpected-it-challenges-of-api-initiatives/)

*This post discusses common but often overlooked IT challenges when starting an API initiative, covering the complexity of API management solutions, ensuring system capacity and security, and acquiring necessary design skills. It highlights the importance of aligning IT efforts with business perspectives to avoid creating APIs that are not fit for broader use.*

üîç [What are API Keys and Why are they so important?](https://medium.com/codex/what-are-api-keys-and-why-are-they-so-important-7fb4307575e)

*This article explains that API keys serve to identify client applications, enabling servers to track usage, block invalid requests, and enforce rate limits to prevent abuse. It stresses the importance of securely storing keys and clarifies that they are for application identification, not user authentication.*

üîç [Choosing between raw and processed data when designing an API](https://apihandyman.io/choosing-between-raw-and-processed-data-when-designing-an-api/)

*This article explores the trade-offs between exposing raw data versus processed data in an API, using the example of returning a date of birth versus a calculated age. It argues that providing processed data can improve developer experience by centralizing business logic and enhance security by avoiding the exposure of sensitive raw information.*

üîç [Why do we need API design guidelines?](https://apihandyman.io/why-do-we-need-api-design-guidelines/)

*API design guidelines are crucial for creating a consistent and user-friendly API surface, which speeds up adoption and reduces integration errors for developers. They also streamline development by minimizing repetitive debates over stylistic choices and provide a basis for automating design validation and reviews.*

üîç [A Standardized, Specification-Driven API Lifecycle](https://www.infoq.com/articles/Standardized-Specification-Driven-API-Lifecycle)

*This article advocates for using specifications like OpenAPI and AsyncAPI to drive a standardized API lifecycle, from design and documentation to testing, security, and code generation. A specification-driven approach fosters collaboration, enables automation, and provides a framework for governance, ensuring consistency and quality across an organization's APIs.*

üîç [Don't organize APIs against ownership](https://apihandyman.io/dont-organize-apis-against-ownership/)

*The article argues that the most critical dimension for organizing APIs is ownership, asserting that a dedicated team must have long-term responsibility, decision-making authority, and control over development. Without clear ownership, APIs are prone to inconsistent evolution, poor design, and an inability to meet the needs of all consumers effectively.*

üîç [5 Patterns for API Monetization | How to make money with APIs](https://api-university.com/blog/api-business/patterns-for-api-monetization/)

It highlights how Kafka's real-time data streaming capabilities and features like the Transaction API provide the resilience and exactly-once semantics required for mission-critical transactional systems.*

üîç [Why ZooKeeper Was Replaced with KRaft -- The Log of All Logs](https://www.confluent.io/blog/why-replace-zookeeper-with-kafka-raft-the-log-of-all-logs/)

*This article explains the move from ZooKeeper to KRaft for Apache Kafka's metadata management to overcome scalability bottlenecks and improve recovery times. KRaft uses a Raft-based consensus protocol to manage a metadata log directly within Kafka, creating a more scalable, self-contained, and resilient system.*

üîç [Kafka vs. Kinesis: A Deep Dive Comparison](https://streamsets.com/blog/kafka-vs-kinesis/)

*This article provides a detailed comparison between Apache Kafka and Amazon Kinesis for data streaming, covering aspects like architecture, data processing models, pricing, and ease of use. While Kafka offers greater flexibility and is open-source, Kinesis provides a fully managed service that is tightly integrated with the AWS ecosystem, making it easier to set up but with potential for vendor lock-in.*

### Kong

üîç [Why We're Deprecating Cassandra Support](https://konghq.com/blog/cassandra-support-deprecated/)
