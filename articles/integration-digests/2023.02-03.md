üîç [Contrasting API Contract Testing and Functional Testing](https://apievangelist.com/2023/03/10/contrasting-api-contract-testing-and-functional-testing/)

*This article by Kin Lane, the API Evangelist, delves into the distinctions between API contract testing and functional testing. It clarifies that while both are crucial for API quality, they serve different purposes. Functional testing validates the API's overall behavior and functionality, ensuring it works as expected from a user's perspective. In contrast, contract testing focuses on verifying that an API adheres to its defined contract, ensuring that interactions between services (e.g., a consumer and a provider) are compatible without needing to test the entire system. The post emphasizes that contract testing is not a replacement for functional testing but a complementary practice that helps catch integration issues early in the development lifecycle.*

üîç [API Rate Limiting vs. API Throttling: How Are They Different?](https://nordicapis.com/api-rate-limiting-vs-api-throttling-how-are-they-different/)

*This Nordic APIs article clarifies the often-confused concepts of API rate limiting and API throttling. Rate limiting is defined as a mechanism to control the number of requests a user can make to an API within a specific time frame, primarily to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage. Throttling, on the other hand, is about managing the processing of API requests on the server side to prevent the system from being overwhelmed. While rate limiting is a hard cap on requests, throttling is a more dynamic approach to control the flow of data. The article emphasizes that both are essential for maintaining API performance and reliability.*

üîç [5 Essential Principles of API Security](https://nordicapis.com/5-essential-principles-of-api-security/)

*This article outlines five fundamental principles for securing APIs, which are critical given their role in modern applications. The principles discussed are: 1) Strong Authentication and Authorization to ensure only legitimate users and applications can access the API; 2) Data Encryption to protect data in transit and at rest; 3) Input Validation to prevent common vulnerabilities like injection attacks; 4) Rate Limiting and Throttling to protect against denial-of-service attacks; and 5) Comprehensive Logging and Monitoring to detect and respond to security incidents. The article serves as a practical guide for developers and security professionals to build more secure APIs.*

üîç [Schemas are not contracts](https://pactflow.io/blog/schemas-are-not-contracts/)

*This Pactflow blog post argues that while API schemas (like OpenAPI or JSON Schema) are a crucial part of an API's design, they should not be equated with API contracts. The author contends that schemas only define the structure and type of data, but they don't capture the expected behavior or the interactions between a consumer and a provider. A true contract, as the article explains, involves an agreement on the interactions, and this is where consumer-driven contract testing tools like Pact come in. They allow for the verification of these interaction-based contracts, ensuring that changes in the provider don't break the consumer, a level of assurance that schemas alone cannot provide.*
