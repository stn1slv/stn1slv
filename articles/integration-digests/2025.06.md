üîç [API Design Antipattern: Leaky Abstractions](https://apidesignmatters.substack.com/p/api-design-antipattern-leaky-abstractions)

_The article warns against "Leaky Abstractions" in API design, where internal implementation details unnecessarily bleed into the API interface, creating usability problems for consumers. When APIs expose implementation quirks like arbitrary character limits or internal codes (exemplified by communication method enums like "EMAL" instead of "EMAIL"), they increase cognitive load, impede adoption, and create brittle designs that break when internal systems change._

üîç [Automating API Discovery with RFC 9727](https://apichangelog.substack.com/p/automating-api-discovery-with-rfc-9727)

_RFC 9727 introduces the "api-catalog" standard that enables programmatic discovery of APIs through well-known URIs, HTML link relations, or HTTP headers, solving the challenge of machines finding and using APIs. The standard, developed by Kevin Smith at Vodafone over two years, allows publishers to create machine-readable documents that provide information about their available APIs, including links to descriptions and documentation in the Linkset format._

üîç [How Model Context Protocol (MCP) Impacts APIs](https://nordicapis.com/how-model-context-protocol-mcp-impacts-apis/)

_The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an emerging standard designed to help LLMs and AI agents consume services and resources in a structured way, serving as an abstraction layer that allows models to reason about API usage without constant human guidance. Rather than making APIs obsolete, MCP enhances them by standardizing metadata and interactions for AI consumption, representing the next evolution of the API paradigm in the age of agentic AI._

üîç [HTTP 204 Is the Best DELETE Response](https://apichangelog.substack.com/p/http-204-is-the-best-delete-response)

_The article discusses a social media debate sparked by the author's claim that HTTP 204 with an empty body is the best response for DELETE operations rather than HTTP 200 with a response body, supported by MDN documentation and RFC 9110. The author argues that since clients already know the resource ID from the request URL and can retrieve information beforehand if needed, no additional response information is necessary for successful deletions, though specific situations might warrant different approaches._

üîç [Native data lineage in Debezium with OpenLineage](https://debezium.io/blog/2025/06/13/openlineage-integration/)

_The article discusses data lineage in modern complex data ecosystems, explaining how tracking data flow from origin to destination helps with regulatory compliance, quality assurance, and operational efficiency. It details how OpenLineage provides a standardized approach for collecting lineage metadata across systems, and demonstrates Debezium's integration with this framework for visualizing data pipeline connections through tools like Marquez._

üîç [OpenAPI Is Not Enough](https://apichangelog.substack.com/p/openapi-is-not-enough)

_While OpenAPI has become the industry standard for defining REST APIs with benefits like documentation, mocking, testing, and code generation capabilities, it has significant limitations when handling sophisticated APIs due to using JSON Schema as its validation engine. Companies like Elastic, Microsoft (with TypeSpec), and Amazon (with Smithy) have developed alternative approaches that use strongly typed languages as their source of truth for API definitions, generating OpenAPI documents rather than using them as the starting point._

üîç [Starting API Documentation Writers: Obstacles To Watch Out For](https://robertdelwood.medium.com/starting-api-documentation-writers-obstacles-to-watch-out-for-e0907610466f)

_Starting as an API documentation writer requires mastering both technical framework mechanics like OpenAPI and learning to write effectively for a programmer audience, which involves understanding how programmers think and use documentation. The journey presents several challenges including the need to focus on content over format, test all calls using tools like Postman, avoid assuming simplicity, gradually learn programming, and use precise terminology - all essential skills that may take up to two years to develop properly._

üîç [What Is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?](https://nordicapis.com/what-is-model-context-protocol-mcp/)

_Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a rapidly growing protocol that extends the functionality of AI tools like large language models, acting as "apps" for LLMs by connecting them with APIs and data sources. Since its release by Anthropic in November 2024, MCP has developed into an ecosystem of thousands of servers that enhance AI capabilities, offering benefits such as real-time data access, improved security, better scalability, and seamless integration with existing API infrastructure._

üîç [What Is a Shadow API? How to Detect and Prevent Them](https://blog.treblle.com/shadow-apis-explained/)

_Shadow APIs are undocumented and unmanaged APIs operating outside an organization's IT oversight that pose significant security risks including data breaches, compliance violations, and expanded attack surfaces due to lack of proper security controls and monitoring. These hidden endpoints commonly emerge from unretired development systems, decentralized microservices, unauthorized third-party integrations, or legacy systems, requiring robust detection strategies like API discovery tools and governance policies to maintain security._

### Apache Camel

üîç [What‚Äôs new in Red Hat build of Apache Camel 4.10](https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2025/06/02/whats-new-red-hat-build-apache-camel-410)

_Red Hat build of Apache Camel 4.10 introduces enhanced integration capabilities through new components like Smooks and Observability Services, improved developer tooling with Kaoto and JBang, unified observability across runtimes, and expanded cloud platform support. The release features significant improvements to existing components including Kubernetes auto-reload on configmap updates, OAuth2 token management in HTTP component, and a new Artemis plug-in for HawtIO that provides comprehensive AMQ Broker management._

### Apache Kafka

üîç [Introducing KIP-848: The Next Generation of the Consumer Rebalance Protocol](https://www.confluent.io/blog/kip-848-consumer-rebalance-protocol/)

_KIP-848 introduces a new consumer rebalance protocol for Apache Kafka that shifts coordination from clients to the broker-side group coordinator, replacing the classic protocol's stop-the-world approach with an incremental, server-driven reconciliation process. Available in Apache Kafka 4.0, Confluent Cloud, and Confluent Platform 8.0, this protocol significantly reduces consumer downtime, enables faster rebalances, improves stability for large consumer groups, and simplifies configuration through centralized server-side parameters._

üîç [How Agoda Handles Kafka Consumer Failover Across Data Centers](https://medium.com/agoda-engineering/how-agoda-handles-kafka-consumer-failover-across-data-centers-a3edbacef6d0)

_Agoda, which processes over 3 trillion Kafka records daily across multiple data centers, built a custom disaster recovery solution for cross-data center Kafka consumer failover by extending MirrorMaker 2 to enable two-way synchronization of consumer group offsets. Their approach allows for seamless failover and failback between data centers while decoupling producers from consumers, providing critical resilience for their data infrastructure that handles massive scale._

### Azure Logic Apps

üîç [Logic App Standard - When High Memory / CPU usage strikes and what to do](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/integrationsonazureblog/logic-app-standard---when-high-memory--cpu-usage-strikes-and-what-to-do/4425155)

_Monitoring Azure Logic Apps is essential for detecting performance issues like high memory and CPU usage, which can significantly slow down processing times and cause unexpected behavior. The article explains how to effectively monitor resource usage through Health Check features, metrics, and logs, while offering mitigation strategies for common problems like orphaned runs, large payloads, and improper platform settings._

üîç [OpenTelemetry in Azure Logic Apps](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/integrationsonazureblog/opentelemetry-in-azure-logic-apps-standard-and-hybrid/4425403)

_OpenTelemetry provides a vendor-agnostic framework for collecting telemetry data in Logic Apps, enabling standardized monitoring across distributed applications in cloud, hybrid, or on-premises scenarios beyond default Application Insights capabilities. The article outlines how to configure OpenTelemetry in Logic Apps using Visual Studio Code or Azure Portal by modifying the host.json file and setting up environment variables to export telemetry to observability backends like Grafana, Jaeger, or KloudMate._
