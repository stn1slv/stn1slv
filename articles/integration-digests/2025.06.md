## Articles

üîç [API Design Antipattern: Leaky Abstractions](https://apidesignmatters.substack.com/p/api-design-antipattern-leaky-abstractions)

_The article warns against "Leaky Abstractions" in API design, where internal implementation details unnecessarily bleed into the API interface, creating usability problems for consumers. When APIs expose implementation quirks like arbitrary character limits or internal codes (exemplified by communication method enums like "EMAL" instead of "EMAIL"), they increase cognitive load, impede adoption, and create brittle designs that break when internal systems change._

üîç [Automating API Discovery with RFC 9727](https://apichangelog.substack.com/p/automating-api-discovery-with-rfc-9727)

_RFC 9727 introduces the "api-catalog" standard that enables programmatic discovery of APIs through well-known URIs, HTML link relations, or HTTP headers, solving the challenge of machines finding and using APIs. The standard, developed by Kevin Smith at Vodafone over two years, allows publishers to create machine-readable documents that provide information about their available APIs, including links to descriptions and documentation in the Linkset format._

üîç [How Model Context Protocol (MCP) Impacts APIs](https://nordicapis.com/how-model-context-protocol-mcp-impacts-apis/)

_The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an emerging standard designed to help LLMs and AI agents consume services and resources in a structured way, serving as an abstraction layer that allows models to reason about API usage without constant human guidance. Rather than making APIs obsolete, MCP enhances them by standardizing metadata and interactions for AI consumption, representing the next evolution of the API paradigm in the age of agentic AI._

üîç [HTTP 204 Is the Best DELETE Response](https://apichangelog.substack.com/p/http-204-is-the-best-delete-response)

_The article discusses a social media debate sparked by the author's claim that HTTP 204 with an empty body is the best response for DELETE operations rather than HTTP 200 with a response body, supported by MDN documentation and RFC 9110. The author argues that since clients already know the resource ID from the request URL and can retrieve information beforehand if needed, no additional response information is necessary for successful deletions, though specific situations might warrant different approaches._

üîç [Native data lineage in Debezium with OpenLineage](https://debezium.io/blog/2025/06/13/openlineage-integration/)

_The article discusses data lineage in modern complex data ecosystems, explaining how tracking data flow from origin to destination helps with regulatory compliance, quality assurance, and operational efficiency. It details how OpenLineage provides a standardized approach for collecting lineage metadata across systems, and demonstrates Debezium's integration with this framework for visualizing data pipeline connections through tools like Marquez._

üîç [OpenAPI Is Not Enough](https://apichangelog.substack.com/p/openapi-is-not-enough)

_While OpenAPI has become the industry standard for defining REST APIs with benefits like documentation, mocking, testing, and code generation capabilities, it has significant limitations when handling sophisticated APIs due to using JSON Schema as its validation engine. Companies like Elastic, Microsoft (with TypeSpec), and Amazon (with Smithy) have developed alternative approaches that use strongly typed languages as their source of truth for API definitions, generating OpenAPI documents rather than using them as the starting point._

üîç [OpenAPI Format: A GUI for Overlays](https://docs.bump.sh/guides/openapi/openapi-format-overlays/)

_The OpenAPI Format Playground provides a user-friendly graphical interface for creating and applying OpenAPI overlays, which allow users to "patch" API descriptions with additional content. This tool helps overcome the steep learning curve of overlays by providing a visual way to write JSONPath targets and create update/remove actions, making it easier for technical writers and developers to enhance API documentation without struggling with the underlying technical complexities._

üîç [Starting API Documentation Writers: Obstacles To Watch Out For](https://robertdelwood.medium.com/starting-api-documentation-writers-obstacles-to-watch-out-for-e0907610466f)

_Starting as an API documentation writer requires mastering both technical framework mechanics like OpenAPI and learning to write effectively for a programmer audience, which involves understanding how programmers think and use documentation. The journey presents several challenges including the need to focus on content over format, test all calls using tools like Postman, avoid assuming simplicity, gradually learn programming, and use precise terminology - all essential skills that may take up to two years to develop properly._

üîç [What Is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?](https://nordicapis.com/what-is-model-context-protocol-mcp/)

_Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a rapidly growing protocol that extends the functionality of AI tools like large language models, acting as "apps" for LLMs by connecting them with APIs and data sources. Since its release by Anthropic in November 2024, MCP has developed into an ecosystem of thousands of servers that enhance AI capabilities, offering benefits such as real-time data access, improved security, better scalability, and seamless integration with existing API infrastructure._

üîç [What Is a Shadow API? How to Detect and Prevent Them](https://blog.treblle.com/shadow-apis-explained/)

_Shadow APIs are undocumented and unmanaged APIs operating outside an organization's IT oversight that pose significant security risks including data breaches, compliance violations, and expanded attack surfaces due to lack of proper security controls and monitoring. These hidden endpoints commonly emerge from unretired development systems, decentralized microservices, unauthorized third-party integrations, or legacy systems, requiring robust detection strategies like API discovery tools and governance policies to maintain security._

üîç [Why I Built the Same API Twice (And What It Taught Me About gRPC vs REST)](https://medium.com/@xsronhou/why-i-built-the-same-api-twice-and-what-it-taught-me-about-grpc-vs-rest-d5ab9e2a671a)

_The article shares a software engineer's experience of building both REST and gRPC versions of a chat application API to resolve a team debate. While gRPC showed technical advantages like faster message delivery, better file uploads, and reduced battery drain, 85% of users noticed no difference, revealing that engineering debates often optimize for metrics users don't perceive and suggesting selective implementation may be wiser than all-or-nothing approaches._

### Apache Camel
