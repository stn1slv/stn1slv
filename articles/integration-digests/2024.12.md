🔍 [Introduction to OpenAPI Overlay Specification](https://nordicapis.com/introduction-to-openapi-overlay-specification/)

_The article introduces the OpenAPI Overlay Specification, a new tool for standardizing updates to OpenAPI descriptions.

The article provides an example of using Overlay to update server information in an OpenAPI document. It highlights Overlay's versatility throughout the API lifecycle, from applying security requirements to standardizing error responses. While tooling support is still developing, the article suggests that implementing Overlay can be a valuable investment for API providers looking to improve their description management processes._
