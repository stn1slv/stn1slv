üîç [A Buy-now, Pay-later Use Case for Arazzo](https://www.openapis.org/blog/2024/07/19/buy-now-pay-later-arazzo)

_The Arazzo Specification, a description language for APIs, can be applied across various industries, including financial services where APIs often need to be called in sequence for operations like account opening and payments. A specific use case is the Buy-now, Pay-later (BNPL) service which typically requires multiple API calls to secure a loan at the point of purchase._

üîç [Choosing the Right Messaging System: Kafka, Redis, RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ, and NATS Compared](https://medium.com/@sheikh.hamza.arshad/choosing-the-right-messaging-system-kafka-redis-rabbitmq-activemq-and-nats-compared-fa2dd385976f)

_The article compares five popular messaging systems: Apache Kafka, Redis, RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ, and NATS, in terms of their core features, scalability, performance, complexity, and typical use cases. The author concludes that each system is best suited for specific scenarios, with Kafka ideal for real-time data streaming, Redis for real-time analytics, RabbitMQ for complex routing, ActiveMQ for enterprise application integration, and NATS for lightweight, low-latency messaging in microservices architectures._

üîç [Control Flow ‚Äî The Other Half of Integration Patterns](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/ramblings/queues_control_flow.html)

_The article discusses the importance of control flow in asynchronous systems and how it can be represented using the Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIP) icons. Gregor Hohpe explains how control flow, which determines the operational characteristics of a distributed system like scalability, robustness, or latency, can be represented using different shapes and directions in the EIP icons, and how this visual language can simplify the understanding of complex distributed systems._

üîç [Debezium asynchronous engine](https://debezium.io/blog/2024/07/08/async-embedded-engine/)

_The article discusses the new implementation of Debezium engine, AsyncEmbeddedEngine, which addresses the main shortcomings of the previous EmbeddedEngine. The new engine allows connectors to execute multiple tasks and aims to run record processing in parallel. It also introduces new configuration options related to thread management. The author also mentions that starting from Debezium 2.6.0.Alpha2, Debezium server has switched to use AsyncEmbeddedEngine. The article concludes with future plans for the Debezium engine, including a switch to Java 21, performance testing, and adding support for gRPC and Protocol Buffers._

üîç [RabbitMQ Queue Types Explained](https://www.cloudamqp.com/blog/rabbitmq-queue-types.html)

_The article discusses the different types of queues in RabbitMQ: Classic Queues, Quorum Queues, Stream Queues, and MQTT QoS 0 Queue. Each queue type caters to different use cases and offers unique features. Classic Queues are suitable for less critical applications, Quorum Queues ensure high availability and data safety, Stream Queues are ideal for high throughput scenarios, and MQTT QoS 0 Queue provides fast, low-latency messaging in large-scale use cases._

üîç [Should You Build Or Buy OpenAPI Tooling?](https://nordicapis.com/should-you-build-or-buy-openapi-tooling/)

_Building your own OpenAPI tools can be beneficial for specific use cases, version support, and ownership. However, the vast ecosystem of OpenAPI tools can cater to most developers' needs, making buying or using open-source tools a viable option. The article suggests that the decision depends on the specific needs and context of the organization or project. It also proposes the idea of tooling "profiles" that describe features important to a well-defined use case to help guide the decision._

üîç [Using TypeSpec to Design APIs](https://nordicapis.com/using-typespec-to-design-apis/)

_TypeSpec allows developers to create components that can be reused across services and aims to be lightweight, familiar, and easy to use. The article provides a tutorial on how to design APIs with TypeSpec, covering topics such as services and servers, routes and resources, path and query parameters, headers, request and response bodies, and status codes._

üîç [What Is An API Definition?](https://nordicapis.com/what-is-an-api-definition/)

_The author highlights the benefits of API definitions, including consistency, standardization, improved collaboration, automated documentation, easier maintenance, and enhanced testing. The article also compares different API specifications such as OpenAPI, RAML, and API Blueprint, each with its unique features and advantages. The author concludes by emphasizing the importance of choosing the right API definition for the success of an API project._


üîç [What is the Arazzo Specification?](https://nordicapis.com/what-is-the-arazzo-specification/)

_The article provides a detailed guide on how to use the Arazzo Specification, highlighting its benefits such as improved consistency, enhanced collaboration, automated API documentation generation, easier maintenance, and enhanced testing._
