🔍 [MQTT vs Kafka, HTTP, HTTPS, and CoAP UDP: Optimizing IoT Device Communication](https://medium.com/data-motion/mqtt-vs-kafka-http-https-and-coap-udp-optimizing-iot-device-communication-aad3120c98b2) 

_The article compares four protocols for IoT device communication: MQTT, Kafka, HTTP, and CoAP. MQTT is the best choice for most IoT use cases because it is lightweight, scalable, easy to set up, and secure. Kafka is a better choice for applications that need to handle large volumes of data, but it is more complex and difficult to set up. HTTP and HTTPS are not as well-suited for IoT devices because they are not as efficient for real-time data transmission._

🔍 [Introducing Versioned State Store in Kafka Streams](https://www.confluent.io/blog/introducing-versioned-state-store-in-kafka-streams/)

_Apache Kafka Streams introduces versioned state stores, which allow users to store multiple record versions per key, rather than only the single latest version per key as is the case for existing key-value stores today._
_The article discusses the benefits of using versioned state stores in Kafka Streams, such as the ability to track the history of a key-value pair, the ability to replay events, and the ability to handle conflicting updates. It also provides a brief overview of how to use versioned state stores in Kafka Streams._
