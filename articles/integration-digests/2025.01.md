üîç [Build API clients with Microsoft Kiota](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3803379/build-api-clients-with-microsoft-kiota.html)

_Project Kiota is a Microsoft tool that automates API client development using OpenAPI definitions, supporting multiple programming languages and toolchains. The tool simplifies development by generating standardized client code from API descriptions, eliminating the need to learn different REST libraries for each language while providing basic tools for JSON payload handling and allowing developers to specify which elements of an OpenAPI description to implement._

üîç [OpenAPI is hard](https://quobix.com/articles/openapi-is-hard/)

_This article discusses the complexity of working with OpenAPI and explains why building tools to handle OpenAPI specifications is surprisingly challenging. It describes the author's journey in creating a sophisticated system called the OpenAPI Doctor that can effectively handle complex OpenAPI specifications, including features like reference navigation and visualization, while explaining that OpenAPI's complexity stems from it being a composite of multiple languages and standards like YAML, JSON, and JSON Schema._

üîç [Optimizing Large Payloads for Sync/Async Communications](https://arvind4gl.medium.com/optimizing-large-payloads-for-sync-async-communications-fc71eacb6179)

_The article discusses optimization strategies for handling large payloads in both synchronous and asynchronous communication patterns in microservices architecture. It provides detailed technical implementations for optimizing data transfer in Spring Boot using techniques like HTTP compression, pagination, and streaming, while also covering Kafka/RabbitMQ optimization strategies such as payload chunking, compression, and external storage solutions._

üîç [Save edits to OpenAPI as an Overlay](https://lornajane.net/posts/2025/save-edits-to-openapi-as-an-overlay)

_The article explains how OpenAPI Overlay Specification allows teams to maintain and preserve changes made to generated OpenAPI files without losing them during regeneration. It describes how overlays can store amendments to OpenAPI documents and demonstrates how to create and apply them using tools like Speakeasy CLI, enabling teams to maintain rich content while working with generated API documentation._

üîç [The MOIST Principle for GraphQL Schema Design](https://magiroux.com/moist-principle)

_The article discusses the MOIST (Mitigate the Overuse of Illusory Shared Types) principle for GraphQL schema design, arguing against excessive type sharing in favor of more specific, context-appropriate types. It explains that while sharing types may seem beneficial for consistency and maintenance, it can lead to problems with API evolution and authorization, suggesting that writing separate types for different contexts is often better than forcing shared types across an API._

üîç [The best API conferences to attend in 2025](https://tyk.io/blog/best-api-conferences/)

_The article presents a comprehensive overview of major API conferences scheduled for 2025, including events like API World, KubeCon, and various apidays conferences across global locations from Singapore to Paris._

üîç [The Top 10 Mistakes Developers Make When Writing APIs (And How to Fix Them)](https://dev.to/balrajola/the-top-10-mistakes-developers-make-when-writing-apis-and-how-to-fix-them-ng3)

_This article outlines the ten most common mistakes developers make when creating APIs, including poor documentation, lack of versioning, inadequate error handling, and insufficient security measures, while providing practical solutions and best practices for each issue to help developers build more robust and user-friendly APIs._

üîç [Wherefore HATEOAS](https://apidesignmatters.substack.com/p/wherefore-hateoas)

_The article discusses Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS) in API design, explaining how it enables API capabilities through embedded hypermedia links in responses and allows for better decoupling between client and server. While HATEOAS works well for web applications with dynamic states and business rules managed on the backend, it presents challenges for general-purpose APIs and requires complex client implementations to handle dynamic features effectively._

üîç [Working with AsyncAPI documents locally](https://www.brainfart.dev/blog/asyncapi-local-setup)

_The article discusses various tools and approaches for working with AsyncAPI documents locally, emphasizing the benefits of minimal, local setups over cloud-based solutions. It explores three main options: using a plain IDE with SchemaStore integration, installing specific IDE plugins/extensions for AsyncAPI, and utilizing the AsyncAPI CLI, with each approach offering different levels of functionality for validation, preview, and document management._
