This can improve the developer experience by providing a clearer understanding of the API's functionality and the sequence of calls needed to achieve a particular goal._

üîç [Managing standards in a developer portal - a how-to guide](https://www.getport.io/blog/managing-standards-in-a-developer-portal)

_This blog post discusses the concept of production readiness and how to manage it using a developer portal. The author defines production readiness as a process that determines the reliability requirements and levels of a specific software component operating in production. The post suggests creating service tiers based on the criticality and risk of software assets and setting appropriate standards for each tier. The author also recommends using scorecards to track the health and progress of each service and application, and automating the collection and analysis of data related to the service's health, compliance, performance, and other key metrics._

üîç [OData vs REST: What You Need to Know](https://blog.dreamfactory.com/odata-vs-rest-what-you-need-to-know)

_This blog post discusses the differences and similarities between OData and REST, two closely related concepts used for building and consuming APIs. The author explains that while REST is an architectural style for exchanging information via the HTTP protocol, OData builds on top of REST to define best practices for building REST APIs. The post highlights the key similarities between OData and REST, including their web-based architecture, statelessness, data format flexibility, resource-oriented design, and interoperability. The key differences between OData and REST are also outlined, noting that OData offers enhanced query capabilities and standardized metadata, while REST provides simplicity, flexibility, wide adoption, and platform independence._

üîç [Overview of Smithy, an API Description Language From Amazon](https://nordicapis.com/overview-of-smithy-an-api-description-language-from-amazon/)

_This blog post discusses Smithy, an interface description language (IDL) developed by Amazon that offers an efficient and portable model-based solution for building APIs. The author explains that Smithy works by creating models that define resources and operations, and it uses traits to allow for higher customization and constraint. The key advantages of using Smithy, including its protocol-agnostic nature, its focus on a model-driven system that allows for both machine and human readability, and its open-source status, are highlighted. However, potential drawbacks of Smithy, such as the issues associated with code generation and the potential for the tool to be too complex for simple projects, are also noted._

üîç [The 5 Worst Anti-Patterns in API Management](https://thenewstack.io/the-5-worst-anti-patterns-in-api-management/)

_This blog post discusses the five worst anti-patterns in API management that should be avoided. These include: Monolith-Microservices, where API management is used as a shortcut to execute application code; Cart Before the Horse, where a complex API management solution is chosen without considering current needs; Good Enough as Code, where API management is partially implemented as code; Chaotic Versioning System, where there is no consistent versioning strategy for APIs; and YOLO Dependencies Management, where there is no enforced dependency management for APIs. The author suggests that avoiding these anti-patterns can lead to a more efficient and reliable API management process._

üîç [The Benefits and Drawbacks of Adopting APIs.json](https://nordicapis.com/the-benefits-and-drawbacks-of-adopting-apis-json/)

_This blog post discusses APIs.json, a format for describing API metadata. The author explains that APIs.json works by creating models that define resources and operations, and it uses traits to allow for higher customization and constraint. The benefits of using APIs.json, such as its protocol-agnostic nature, its focus on a model-driven system that allows for both machine and human readability, and its open-source status, are highlighted. However, potential drawbacks of APIs.json, such as the lack of consensus around the standard, the limited adoption of the standard despite its capabilities, and the lack of guidance on implementing extensions, are also noted._

üîç [The Deficient Areas of API Alignment](http://apievangelist.com/2024/06/19/the-deficient-areas-of-api-alignment/)

_This blog post discusses the challenges in aligning APIs, focusing on the deficiencies between API producers and consumers, and the business and technical aspects of APIs. The author argues that while APIs are technically well-defined using machine-readable artifacts like OpenAPI, GraphQL Schema, AsyncAPI, and JSON Schema, the business side of APIs, including onboarding, pricing, terms of service, and SLAs, is often not as well-defined or machine-readable._
