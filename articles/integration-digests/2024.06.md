üîç [The 5 Worst Anti-Patterns in API Management](https://thenewstack.io/the-5-worst-anti-patterns-in-api-management/)

_The blog post discusses the five worst anti-patterns in API management that should be avoided. These include: Monolith-Microservices, where API management is used as a shortcut to execute application code; Cart Before the Horse, where a complex API management solution is chosen without considering current needs; Good Enough as Code, where API management is partially implemented as code; Chaotic Versioning System, where there is no consistent versioning strategy for APIs; and YOLO Dependencies Management, where there is no enforced dependency management for APIs. The author suggests that avoiding these anti-patterns can lead to a more efficient and reliable API management process. The post concludes by emphasizing the importance of designing the API platform with a strong separation of concerns, proceeding step by step, not tolerating exceptions in industrializing processes, starting the API journey with a strong and consistent versioning strategy, and controlling and certifying runtime dependencies for all components._
