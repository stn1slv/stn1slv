🔍 [API Description Pipelines](https://lornajane.net/posts/2024/pipelines-api-descriptions)

_The blog post discusses the process of creating API description pipelines, which are workflows used in software development for managing and monitoring the performance of software applications. The author outlines various steps that might be included in an API description pipeline, such as gathering inputs, improving the OpenAPI description, setting up traditional CI checks, enabling proxy behaviours, and implementing notifications for critical errors. The author also provides tool recommendations for each step and emphasises the importance of customising the pipeline to suit the needs of each individual organisation and API project._
