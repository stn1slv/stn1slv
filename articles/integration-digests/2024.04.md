It also mentions that TypeSpec provides a lightweight language for describing and designing APIs, and it's easy to integrate into an OpenAPI toolchain. The article further explains that TypeSpec allows API guidelines to be expressed in reusable code. The article suggests that while TypeSpec has its advantages, its suitability for a particular user would depend on their specific needs and preferences._

üîç [Fixing duplicate API requests](https://dev.to/apisix/fixing-duplicate-api-requests-1n7o)

_The article discusses the issue of duplicate API requests in distributed systems and introduces the concept of idempotency as a solution. Idempotency refers to operations that can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application. The author refers to the IETF specification "The Idempotency-Key HTTP Header Field", which suggests using a unique key sent by the client along with the request. If the server already has a record of the key-request pair, it discards the request; if not, it stores the pair. The article also outlines potential error scenarios and the corresponding HTTP status codes. The author concludes by suggesting that the behavior described could be factored into an API Gateway, and plans to explore implementing this behavior in Apache APISIX in a future post._

The author emphasizes the need for a robust approach to maintaining backwards compatibility due to potential disruptions caused by changes in the service. The article further explores various strategies for maintaining backwards compatibility, including versioning GraphQL objects, parameterizing versions, and adopting a versionless API approach. The author also discusses the use of conventions and automation tools like GraphQL Inspector to prevent potential issues. The article concludes by highlighting the importance of balancing innovation and stability in GraphQL to ensure a smooth user experience._

üîç [You probably don't need GraphQL](https://mxstbr.com/thoughts/graphql/)

_The author argues that while GraphQL is a powerful tool, it may not be necessary for all use cases. GraphQL was designed as a central intermediary layer between various end-user-facing clients and data sources. It is particularly useful for maintaining backwards compatibility, preventing mobile apps from breaking after API changes, improving loading times by reducing request waterfalls and overfetching, simplifying maintenance and endpoint discovery, and enhancing security and performance. However, for simpler or smaller-scale projects, the author suggests that other solutions may be more appropriate. The author concludes that while GraphQL may not be necessary for all projects, it can be a valuable tool when specific problems arise._

üîç [What is API-as-a-Service?](https://nordicapis.com/what-is-api-as-a-service/)

_The article discusses the concept of API-as-a-Service (APIaaS), a technology solution that provides systems and services to develop, deploy, and manage APIs at scale. The author explains that APIs, as value-adding systems, enable businesses to connect and translate disparate systems, creating a unified ecosystem. However, developing APIs can be costly and complex. APIaaS offers a solution by providing functions and resources as a service, reducing costs and simplifying the process. The author discusses the benefits of APIaaS, such as improved efficiency, reduced time-to-market, and better utilization of resources. However, he also notes potential drawbacks, including loss of control, security concerns, and cost variability. The author concludes that the decision to implement APIaaS should be based on the organization's need for efficiency versus control._

### Apache APISIX

üîç [Implementing the Idempotency-Key specification on Apache APISIX](https://blog.frankel.ch/implement-idempotency-key-apisix/)

_The article discusses the implementation of the IETF Idempotency-Key specification using Apache APISIX. The Idempotency-Key specification aims to avoid duplicated requests by allowing the client to send a unique key with the request. If the server doesn't know the key, it proceeds as usual and then stores the response. If the server knows the key, it immediately returns the stored response. The article provides a step-by-step guide on how to implement this specification with Apache APISIX, including the creation of a plugin, configuring the Redis client, implementing the nominal path, and managing error paths. The author concludes by stating that while the current implementation is simple, it can be improved by adding automated tests, configuring Redis on a per-route basis, and using other key/value stores._

üîç [Five ways to pass parameters to Apache APISIX](https://blog.frankel.ch/pass-parameters-apisix/)

_The article discusses how to pass parameters to Apache APISIX, an open-source API gateway. It covers five methods: path variables, query parameters, request headers, request body, and cookies. For each method, the author provides the corresponding API or method in APISIX or Nginx for accessing the parameters. The author concludes by summarizing these methods and acknowledging a reviewer's contributions._

### Apache Kafka

üîç [Schema Registry Clients in Action](https://www.confluent.io/blog/how-schema-registry-clients-work/)

_The article provides an in-depth explanation of how the Schema Registry works in conjunction with Apache Kafka, focusing on the behind-the-scenes processes that occur when messages are serialized and deserialized. The Schema Registry is a component that manages and stores schemas for data exchanged between Kafka producers and consumers, ensuring data quality, compatibility, and consistency. The article also discusses the use of data quality rules on the schema, which are crucial for maintaining high data integrity and simplifying schema evolution. Lastly, the article provides a demonstration of how to use the Confluent Schema Registry without Apache Kafka, emphasizing that a producer or consumer client independently communicates with two separate systems: Apache Kafka and the Schema Registry._
