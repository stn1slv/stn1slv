## Articles

üîç [Announcing OpenAPI v3.2](https://www.openapis.org/blog/2025/09/23/announcing-openapi-v3-2)

_OpenAPI v3.2.0 (GA minor release) adds several specification-level capabilities that shift API modelling and tooling: multipurpose nested Tags with kind for taxonomy-driven rendering and codegen, a formal query HTTP method and querystring Schema Object for richer idempotent queries, explicit streaming media types with itemSchema for event/stream handling, and OAuth2 Device Authorization plus oauth2MetadataUrl for improved discovery._

üîç [A Year‚Äôs Evolution of AI and APIs: A World Apart](https://nordicapis.com/a-years-evolution-of-ai-and-apis-a-world-apart/)

_Kristen Womack outlines how agentic AI and MCP are enabling models to maintain context, make function calls, and orchestrate APIs; the piece provides practical, integration-focused guidance‚Äîaudit API metadata and OpenAPI semantics, ensure context/state management, implement robust auth/error handling, and guard against data-quality and over-privilege risks‚Äîto prepare enterprise APIs for agent-driven automation._

üîç [API Gateway Evolution: How 6 New Platforms Reinvent Traffic Management for Scalable Microservices](https://dev.to/igarakh/api-gateway-evolution-how-6-new-platforms-reinvent-traffic-management-for-scalable-microservices-gp1)

_Presents a practical comparative analysis of six modern API gateway platforms and the concrete traffic-management techniques they use: hybrid token buckets synchronized via gossip, reactive rate limiting tied to circuit breakers, AI-augmented anomaly-aware throttling, and latency/locality-aware routing. Includes benchmark figures and config snippets to help architects choose patterns and platforms for 100k+ RPS, resilient auth flows, and graceful deployments._

üîç [API gateway shapes: back then, now, and beyond](https://dev.to/ngrok/api-gateway-shapes-back-then-now-and-beyond-29po)

_The article introduces eight practical API gateway shapes (e.g., agent-assisted, localhost-en-masse, edge/device, universal gateway) that address modern constraints: local-first development, LLM-driven endpoints, multi-cloud/CI deployments, and shift-left security/observability. It focuses on how gateways can offload auth, rate limiting, and traffic transformation earlier in the lifecycle and enable consistent routing and security across ephemeral and distributed service endpoints, providing architects a concrete taxonomy to design flexible gateway deployments._

üîç [Everything You Need to Know About MCP Support and API Enablement](https://www.gravitee.io/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-mcp-support-and-api-enablement)

_Gravitee presents a practical integration pattern for Model Context Protocol (MCP): its MCP Tool Server auto-generates machine-readable API descriptions from OpenAPI, exposes an MCP entrypoint on a v4 proxy, and enables agent discovery and runtime use (e.g., via SSE) while enforcing auth, rate limits, logging, and observability at the gateway. The piece is useful for architects wanting a deployable path to safely expose REST APIs as tools for AI agents without backend changes._

üîç [How LLMs Are Breaking the API Contract (And Why That Matters)](https://nordicapis.com/how-llms-are-breaking-the-api-contract-and-why-that-matters/)

_Examines how LLM hallucinations, prompt injection, and agentic pipelines break API contracts and proposes concrete API-side mitigations: maintain machine-readable OpenAPI specs and canonical naming for reliable retrieval, enforce agent RBAC and rate limits, add friction for sensitive operations, implement zero trust for plugins, and add observability/audit trails so architects can detect and contain errant AI-driven calls._

üîç [MCP API Gateway Explained: Protocols, Caching, and Remote Server Integration](https://www.gravitee.io/blog/mcp-api-gateway-explained-protocols-caching-and-remote-server-integration)

_This vendor-authored technical guide explains how an MCP API Gateway intermediates AI clients and MCP servers by translating transports (stdio vs HTTP/SSE), enforcing auth/authorization, routing JSON-RPC methods to appropriate backends, and applying targeted caching (favoring read-heavy resources, avoiding side-effect calls). It provides concrete protocol-level guidance and operational patterns for building resilient, scalable MCP gateway deployments._

üîç [Review of 10 Managed MCP Platforms](https://nordicapis.com/review-of-10-managed-mcp-platforms/)

_Practical vendor roundup of 10 managed MCP platforms that helps integration teams weigh trade-offs across authentication/governance, observability, connector breadth, hosting model and pricing. Useful as an early market map for architects evaluating MCP-based agentic integrations; highlights which vendors favor turnkey governance, deep tool catalogs, or self-hosted control and where custom engineering will be required._

_Provides actionable patterns for streaming data over REST: server-side chunked responses and JSONL/NDJSON (RFC 7464) for line-delimited JSON, SSE for event streams, and Accept-based content negotiation; includes an Express.js example and discusses documenting streams in OpenAPI v3.2, making it useful for architects needing memory-efficient, real-time REST solutions._

üîç [The New API Economy With LLMs](https://dzone.com/articles/new-api-economy-with-llms)

_Presents language-as-API as an integration shift and offers practical patterns: use prompt templates and function-calling/agent patterns to translate intents into deterministic API calls, implement guardrails and a lightweight failure-detection/validation model to catch hallucinations, enforce access controls, and adopt LLMOps for monitoring and iterative prompt/version management._

üîç [The OpenAPI Registry](https://apichangelog.substack.com/p/the-openapi-registry)

_Timely proposal advocating an official OpenAPI registry to solve API discoverability by offering a trusted catalog; the author analyzes MCP's new registry as a model and recommends concrete implementation options (Apigee Registry with gRPC, Apicurio, Scalar with GitHub Actions) and extension patterns so producers can publish authoritative OpenAPI docs and consumers can search and onboard quickly._

üîç [The Perils of Platform Plumbing (and What to Do About It)](https://matthewreinbold.com/2025/09/30/platformsAsPlumbing)

_Argues that successful internal developer platforms often become invisible and subject to reactive funding cuts; offers a pragmatic survival playbook: translate technical work into business narratives, instrument outcome metrics (time saved, cost avoided, risk reduced), and align platform initiatives to stakeholder goals. Illustrated by an OpenAPI 3.0 case showing how to turn an engineering upgrade into measurable business impact._

üîç [Why Your Legacy APIs Are a Roadblock for AI Agents](https://thenewstack.io/why-your-legacy-apis-are-a-roadblock-for-ai-agents/)

_Identifies the concrete technical gaps that make legacy APIs unsuitable for agentic AI - insufficient semantic metadata, fragile auth flows, synchronous brittle endpoints and sparse telemetry - and recommends practical integration patterns (lightweight adapter/wrapper layers, semantic contract augmentation, event-driven or streaming endpoints, and improved observability/auth flows) to make APIs discoverable, idempotent and safely automatable by AI agents._

_Provides a comprehensive, numerical sizing methodology for Kafka with KIP-405 tiered storage: it models throughput, replication, IOPS, disk free-space, S3 PUT/GET costs, and local retention to show how tiered storage flips design tradeoffs (fewer brokers, shift from HDD to gp3 SSDs, and much lower monthly storage costs). Actionable assumptions and worked examples make this a practical guide for enterprise architects planning tiered Kafka deployments._

üîç [Kafka at Scale: Why ACLs Fail and Roles Win in 2025](https://blog.dataengineerthings.org/kafka-at-scale-why-acls-fail-and-roles-win-in-2025-3a384c7f3704)
