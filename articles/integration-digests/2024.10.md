üîç [Analyzing the OpenAPI Tooling Ecosystem](https://modern-json-schema.com/analyzing-the-openapi-tooling-ecosystem)

_The post discusses the OAS-based tooling ecosystem, the architecture of OAS-based tools, and the objects and fields defined by the OAS. The author also presents an idealized architecture for OAS-based tools, breaking it down into three main functional areas: parsing libraries, OpenAPI Description (OAD) tools, and API tools._

üîç [Best Practices for Deprecating an API Without Alienating Your Users](https://blog.treblle.com/best-practices-deprecating-api/)

_Deprecating an API requires careful planning, clear communication, and proper tools to ensure a smooth transition for users. Key steps include announcing the deprecation early, providing clear timelines, updating documentation, explaining the reasons for deprecation, offering a migration path, and directly communicating with affected users. Post-deprecation support, including archiving documentation and gathering feedback, can also help improve the process for future deprecations._

üîç [gRPC: 5 Years Later, Is It Still Worth It?](https://kostyay.com/grpc-5-years-later-is-it-still-worth-it-b181a3b2b73b)

_Five years after adopting gRPC and Protobuf for their projects, the team at Torq reflects on the decision, stating that it has brought several advantages including maintaining backward compatibility, enforcing standards through linting, and reducing discrepancies by using the same generated code for both clients and servers. The growth and improvements in the gRPC ecosystem, particularly the contributions of the buf.build team, are also praised. Despite some challenges with gRPC-web in frontend code, the team would still choose gRPC as the primary communication protocol for a new project._

üîç [The Eight Pillars of API Security](https://nordicapis.com/the-eight-pillars-of-api-security/)

_The article discusses the eight pillars of API security, which are crucial for data protection, reputation management, and compliance.

üîç [What is an API Review?](https://apievangelist.com/2024/10/11/what-is-an-api-review/)

_An API review is a process that evaluates the design, self-service capabilities, technical details, business concerns, lifecycle, team involvement, enforcement, exceptions, automation, rules, policies, strategy, guidance, education, artifacts, source of truth, history, progress, and change management of an API. The review can be conducted in-person or asynchronously, and its purpose is to ensure the consistent and effective design, development, and delivery of APIs, while also facilitating learning, engagement, and alignment among teams._

üîç [What is API Drift, and What Can You Do About It?](https://nordicapis.com/what-is-api-drift-and-what-can-you-do-about-it/)

_API drift, a worrying trend in the tech industry, occurs when an API's implementation shifts away from its initial design, specification, or expected behaviors, often due to poor planning and lack of rigorous controls. To mitigate API drift, organizations can employ consistent guardrails in their development lifecycle, use versioning to set apart breaking changes and new features, and regularly review and update API documentation throughout development._

üîç [Writing an OpenAPI Document from the Ground Up](https://bump.sh/blog/openapi-from-ground-up)

_The article provides a step-by-step guide on creating an OpenAPI document for a TODO list API, emphasizing the importance of an iterative approach to API design and documentation. The process starts with defining essential metadata, gradually expanding to operation details and security specifications, and continuously refining and updating the document based on feedback from stakeholders and changes in business requirements or technology._

## Standards

üîó [Announcing OpenAPI Specification versions 3.0.4 and 3.1.1](https://www.openapis.org/blog/2024/10/25/announcing-openapi-specification-patch-releases)

_The OpenAPI Initiative has announced a patch release of the 3.0 and 3.1 OpenAPI Specifications. The patch release, which includes many updates, expansions and clarifications to the specification wording, does not change the way APIs are described or the structure, so existing tooling should work without issues. The 3.1.1 version is recommended for new projects or upgrades, while 3.0.4 is the final release in the 3.0.x line._

üîó [Announcing OpenAPI Overlay Specification 1.0.0](https://www.openapis.org/blog/2024/10/22/announcing-overlay-specification)

_The Overlay Specification is an auxiliary standard designed to complement the existing OpenAPI specification. It provides a way to apply transformations to OpenAPI descriptions as part of API workflows. An Overlay is a JSON or YAML file that contains a list of updates to be applied to an OpenAPI description. The Overlay Specification is expected to help improve developer experience, filter API descriptions, translate API reference documentation, and add tool-specific content._
