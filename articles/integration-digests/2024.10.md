## Standards

🔗 [Announcing OpenAPI Specification versions 3.0.4 and 3.1.1](https://www.openapis.org/blog/2024/10/25/announcing-openapi-specification-patch-releases)

_The OpenAPI Initiative has announced a patch release of the 3.0 and 3.1 OpenAPI Specifications. The patch release, which includes many updates, expansions and clarifications to the specification wording, does not change the way APIs are described or the structure, so existing tooling should work without issues. The 3.1.1 version is recommended for new projects or upgrades, while 3.0.4 is the final release in the 3.0.x line._

🔗 [Announcing OpenAPI Overlay Specification 1.0.0](https://www.openapis.org/blog/2024/10/22/announcing-overlay-specification)

_The Overlay Specification is an auxiliary standard designed to complement the existing OpenAPI specification. It provides a way to apply transformations to OpenAPI descriptions as part of API workflows. An Overlay is a JSON or YAML file that contains a list of updates to be applied to an OpenAPI description. The Overlay Specification is expected to help improve developer experience, filter API descriptions, translate API reference documentation, and add tool-specific content._
